    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 package of Tocino (can be found in asian supermarket)</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1.5 cups of cooked, chilled white rice</li>
      <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>canola oil</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Lay tinfoil on a baking sheet.</li>
      <li>
        Once preheated, bake the tocino for ~20 min or until fat around it is
        black and a char on the meat develops.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium frying pan or skillet, add enough canola oil to create a
        very thin layer that covers the entire cooking surface area and let it
        heat up for 4 min.
      </li>
      <li>While pan/skillet with oil is heating up, finely chop the garlic.</li>
      <li>Add chopped garlic and stir occasionally until golden brown.</li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked, chilled rice. (best if refigerated overnight but 20 min
        in the freezer after freshly cooked is good enough.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Break up and mix the rice until you can see that most of the rice is
        covered in oil. Add more oil if it looks too dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Empty rice from pan/skillet onto a plate and cover to retain heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add about 2 tbsp of more oil. Crack 4 eggs and and cover pan/skillet
        with a lid until desired done-ness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plate breakfast by dividing the garlic fried rice, eggs, and tocino.
      </li>
    </ol>
